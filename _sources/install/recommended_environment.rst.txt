Recommended environment
=======================

Chrities may work well on OSX, Ubuntu, Windows 10 and Raspberry Pi.

Nodejs and npm are needed to install charites. Docker can also be a good environment in Windows while WSL might work well. For charites version 0.3.0 released in December 2022, nodejs ver 14. or later version is recommended.
